# The Personal MBA: Getting Results

* Effective Business = Clear, Calm, Systematic Thinking
* Common Sense & simple arithmetic
* Grasp Principles, not Methods

1) Value Creation - Discovering what people need or want then creating it
2) Marketing - Attracting attention and building demand for what you've created (making people interested)
3) Sales - Turning prospective customers into paying customers
4) Value Delivery - Giving your customers what you've promised and ensuring that they're satisfied
5) Finance - Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile

Part 1 was What businesses do
Part 2 (today) is How to do it

* Acquiring new skills
* Human psychology
* Personal productivity
* Communication & management
* Building systems

The people that don't succeed, don't learn to do the things necessary. The people that succeed realize what they need to learn and then learn it in an efficient way!

## Rapid Skill Acquisition

How to go from knowing absolutely nothing to performing very well as quickly as possible

**Economically Valuable Skills** - Want to build your career? Acquire new & useful skills.

* The 10,000 hour "rule" only applies if you want to compete at the absolute highest level in very specific areas.
* Pick up any new skill in less than 20 hours.

1) Decide what you want
  * Clearly and specifically. Not "I want to learn Italian"
2) Deconstruct the skill
3) Research just enough
  * To determine absolute fundamentals. 3-5 books/courses. Skim them all for recurring points.
  * Careful. Research is fun and easy to get stuck. It can become procrastination.
  * Do just enough to identify important subskills
4) Eliminate barriers
  * Emotional and Physical
5) Precommit to 20 hours

## Knowing vs DOING

  * The more efficiently and effectively you can get things done, the more you can accomplish

* Akrasia - Knowing what you should do, but not doing it
* Monoidealism - Focusing your attention on only ONE thing at a time

4 Methods of Completion: Do it, delete it, delegate it, defer it

Most Important Tasks - Critical tasks that will contribute most to your desired end results

* Habits - Continuous supporting actions that deliver benefits over time

Priming - Consciously programming your brain to notice relevant information
